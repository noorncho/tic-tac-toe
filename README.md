# TicTacToe
A recreation of the classic pen-and-paper game tictactoe.

### Tech Stack
- Vanilla JS ES6
- HTML5
- CSS3 / SASS

### General Info
This game was created during week 4 of the _nology course.

The game has the option to be played either in a single player mode against the computer or in a two player mode. The mode has to be selected before the first move is made or the default two-player mode will start.

### Roadmap / Todo
At the moment the game is playable but in my spare time I will be adding:

- A score tracker
- Improved play mode selection system
- Confetti or animation to win pop-up
